Hey Guys,

So I was thinking today. Gun to head, someone asks - “if you could say one thing that made a team successful, what would it be” 

Ignoring the highly intense and fictitious situation for a moment, my answer would undoubtedly be psychological safety. 

Having said that, I believe there are 2 confidence indicators to monitor as someone with influence or senior status in a team. 

How confident do the team members feel to challenge the leadership or  senior members (productively)

How confident do the team members feel to take on tasks and not be afraid to fail or make mistakes while doing them?

The best teams I’ve worked with, are teams where people are not afraid to challenge ideas or make mistakes - and also where mistakes are not a signal to point fingers or blame. 

I’m inspired by the approach the amazing leaders on my current and past teams have taken when it comes to ensuring team members feel psychologically safe. 

I continue to learn from and use their examples in the current teams I’m in and the future teams I will be in. 

I’ve seen firsthand what a team that feels psychologically safe can accomplish and it’s not just about the results. 

It’s a surefire way to ensure that the members of the team grow and become leaders themselves. 

So whatever you can do to make your team feel psychologically safe today…. DO IT
