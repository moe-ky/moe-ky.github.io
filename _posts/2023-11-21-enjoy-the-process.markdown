Do you think something is wrong with you when you can’t “Enjoy The Process”?

Hopefully not, but in case you do I hope the rest of this note will help alleviate some of that negative thinking.

………….

We’ve all at one point heard the phrase “enjoy the process”.

This phrase usually appears when you’re on a journey to achieve a personal goal.

In all my time hearing this phrase, I’ve come across little to no content that tells you how to actually “enjoy the process” and what happens if you don’t.

And since necessity is the mother of all invention - I have attempted to conjure something up for myself.

It’s still a work in progress, as is everything in life, but I wanted to share this one thing thats helped me so far - in hope that it will have a positive impact with at least one person today.

So here it is

…………….

REFRAME THE WHOLE PHRASE WITH CONTINUOUS SELF TALK

Why do I do this ?
Well …

there’s one word I don’t like in that aforementioned phrase and it’s “enjoy”.

It makes it sounds like it’s supposed to be fun and will always be fun, all day everyday.

On the contrary I’ve found that not everything you do towards the accomplishment of a worthy ideal is fun.

So what I try to do, is reframe my thinking via self talk to reaffirm that it’s not always going to be fun but it’s going to be rewarding.

For example I’d set a reminder everyday to say something like “difficulty is part of the process, it’s not always supposed to be fun. And coming out the other end of difficulty means I’m getting the work done”

I’ll add an example of a daily notification I’ve set on my phone at the end of this post, for now let me wrap this up.
……….

Going through the pain of the process, can eventually turn into the enjoyment of the process. E.g first time gym goers Vs the version of themselves who are accustomed to working out with weights.

In conclusion, if we go into things thinking “enjoy” the process first - it possibly sets us up for a downfall.

Because we will quickly realize that pain hides within the process, and if we want to learn to enjoy the process we have to learn to suffer it first.
